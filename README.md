# THOR
Tor Hardware Onion Router

## What is this?
This is a script written by torrouters.com to flash routers and make them part of the tor network. Think about it as torbox but on openWrt routers instead of raspberry pi.

## Software Requirments for Windows
If you're on a Windows machine you will need the following installed:
* BASH Shell follow [this guide](https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/), or
* Cygwin package from [this website](https://www.cygwin.com/).
* if  you're on other operating system you probably have `bash` already

## Hardware Requirments
For this to work you need a router with OpenWrt firmware. If you're unsure what does that mean we recommand grabbing one of our ready routers from our website torrouters.com

## How to Flash
1. Read this document
2. Connect the router via ethernet
3. The router should be at IP address `192.168.1.1` or DNS name `openwrt`
4. Double click on `flash-Tor.cmd`
5. Wait until the flashing is over
6. New Wi-Fi will appear according to the settings
    * SSID is "Toriro-2.4ghz" and "Toriro-5.0ghz"
    * PSK is "TorRouters.com"
9. All settings can be changed via web at http://change.torrouters.com/
